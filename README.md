- PyPDF2 library

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone the repository using `git`:

   git clone https://github.com/ThomasCaneday/PDFMerger.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```
4. Install the required library using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install PyPDF2
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the Python script in the directory containing the PDF files you want to merge.
2. Run the script. It will combine all PDF files in the current directory into a single file named `newCombinedPDF.pdf`.
